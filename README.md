# Blackjack Game
# Project Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Blackjack game using Python. The game allows a single player to play against a dealer (computer) to get a hand as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Aces can count as either 1 or 11, and the dealer hits until they reach at least 17. The game incorporates card dealing, betting, and handling various endgame scenarios like busts or pushes.

# Features
Card Class: Represents a playing card with a suit and rank.
Deck Class: Handles deck creation, shuffling, and dealing cards.
Hand Class: Keeps track of a player's or dealer's hand and calculates the hand's value.
Chips Class: Manages player chips, including bets, wins, and losses.
# Game Logic:
Bet placement, hit or stand options.
Automated dealer gameplay.
Handling different game outcomes (win, lose, bust, or tie).
# How to Play
At the start of the game, a player is given 100 chips by default.
The player places a bet.
Both the player and dealer are dealt two cards.
One of the dealer's cards is hidden.
The player can choose to "Hit" (draw a card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
If the player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the bet.
If the player stands, the dealer reveals their hand and continues drawing cards until they reach a hand value of at least 17.
The game compares hands, and the winner is determined.
The player’s chip count is updated based on the result.
